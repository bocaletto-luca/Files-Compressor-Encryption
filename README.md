## Description

This software is designed to help users compress and encrypt their files, making them more secure and reducing the required storage space. Here are the main features offered:

- **Compress files:** Users can select the files they want to compress. The software uses the zlib compression library to reduce the file sizes, using the best available compression level.

- **Encrypt files:** The software allows users to specify an encryption key. It then uses the Fernet cryptography library to encrypt the compressed data. Encryption provides an additional level of security to the files, protecting them from unauthorized access.

- **Extract files:** Users can also use the software to extract files from an encrypted archive. This operation involves decrypting the data and decompressing the files in the archive.

### Management of Archived File Extension

By default, the software uses the ".7bl" extension for archived files, for example, "archived_data.7bl." However, users have the flexibility to change the file extension as they prefer, creating custom extensions or specifying the file name as they wish. The important thing is that the archive's content will be encrypted and compressed regardless of the file extension.

## User Interface

The software offers a simple and intuitive user interface with all the previously mentioned features.

The software uses Python libraries like tkinter, zlib, and cryptography to handle compression and encryption operations. In case of errors or exceptions, the software displays error messages and details through the status label.

In conclusion, "7bl Compressor with Encryption" is a versatile tool for protecting sensitive data and managing files, with a user-friendly interface that allows users to compress, encrypt, and extract their files effectively and securely. Users have complete control over the management of archived file extensions.

In conclusione, "7bl Compressore con Crittografia" Ã¨ uno strumento versatile per la protezione dei dati sensibili e la gestione dei file, con una semplice interfaccia utente che consente agli utenti di comprimere, crittografare ed estrarre i loro file in modo efficace e sicuro. Gli utenti hanno il controllo completo sulla gestione delle estensioni dei file archiviati.
